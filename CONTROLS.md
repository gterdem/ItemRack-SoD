## ⚙️ Relevant Options

## 🔄 Auto-Queue System

The Auto-Queue system automatically swaps items based on cooldown availability:

1. **Enable Queue**: Alt+Left-Click a slot button, or use the Queue tab in Options
2. **Configure Priority**: In the Queue tab, rank items from highest to lowest priority
3. **How it works**: When an equipped item goes on cooldown, ItemRack swaps to the next ready item
4. **Pause Queue**: Check "Pause Queue" on items to prevent them from being swapped out during use
5. **Per-Set Queues**: Gear Sets automatically save and recall which slot queues are currently enabled when you equip them

---

## ⚡ Combat Queue

If you try to swap items while in combat, ItemRack will:
1. Queue the swap for when combat ends
2. Show a small overlay icon on the slot button indicating what's queued
3. Automatically perform the swap when you leave combat

---

## 🔮 Rune Reminders (Season of Discovery)

Enable **"Rune reminders on set equip"** in the Config tab (off by default). When you equip a gear set whose engraved runes differ from what the set saved:

1. A popup lists each slot's `current → target` rune with an **Apply** button.
2. Because engraving requires a real click and runes apply **one at a time**, each click engraves the next rune (never in combat).
3. Item cells in the **Sets** tab show a small **rune icon** (top-right) plus the rune name in the tooltip.
4. Closed it by accident? Reopen with **`/itemrack runes`**.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Most actions that modify buttons or swap gear are **blocked during combat** due to Blizzard's secure action restrictions
- The "Set Button" (slot 20) appears when you Alt+Click the character model frame
- Hidden items can still be seen by holding Alt while hovering over menus (if AllowHidden is enabled)
- TrinketMenuMode combines both trinket slots into a single menu for easier management
